# docbook-samples FAQ

## Why "docbook-samples" project and what does it mean?

There is nothing behind the name of the project. It means exactly what it is - just documentation samples in DocBook/XML 5.1 format :)

## Why "docbook-samples" was created?

Short answer: to make things easy.

Long answer:
The author has two projects: [foponts](https://github.com/eduardtibet/foponts) and [docbook pretty playout](https://github.com/eduardtibet/docbook-pretty-playout) that both need to have some technical "near-real life" documentation samples to work with, that contains a bunch of a markup features, with a complex structure and some text full of a real continuous straightforward narration - not just a [Lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) snippets.

## How can I contact the author?

Just drop me a line to eduard.tibet@gmail.com with a "docbook-samples" in subject line. I'm very curious to hear who is really needed to use this project with a DocBook/XML source files.

For an author's opinion the project is useful only and limited to a following two cases:
- You are a contributor to an other author's projects [foponts](https://github.com/eduardtibet/foponts) and [docbook pretty playout](https://github.com/eduardtibet/docbook-pretty-playout) and use this project as a git submodule.
- You want to evaluate how the author creates a technical documentation itself, including his writing style, attention to details, information structuring and presentation, layout and design, etc. :)
