# docbook-samples project

## About

This is a simple project with a just sample technical documentation files created and maintained by the author.

The aim is to provide real life technical documentation samples for an other author's projects:

- [foponts](https://github.com/eduardtibet/foponts) - configuration file for [Apache FOP](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/) to produce PDFs with a predictable layout result { [why it is important](https://github.com/eduardtibet/foponts/blob/master/FAQ.md#why-foponts-was-created) ) using [OFL-licensed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIL_Open_Font_License) fonts. Highly recommended if a source documents are in Docbook/XML format, written in Russian language or includes any of a Cyrillic characters within. Though, usage is not limited to the Russian language - it can be used for documents written in any language that used fonts support;
- [docbook pretty playout](https://github.com/eduardtibet/docbook-pretty-playout) - DocBook XSL customization layer above the stock ones to produce nice pretty print-related output (mostly PDFs) for any technical documentation authored in DocBook/XML 5.1 format;

**NOTE:** [docbook pretty playout](https://github.com/eduardtibet/docbook-pretty-playout) - is a long-running project, so for now only basic customization over the stock Docbook XSL stylesheets have been made.

## The structure of this project

The project consists of a source `.xml` files (one or many) and other supporting files (images, image sources, etc.).

The overall structure of the project:

```
docbook-samples
  |
  /<software_name> - the name of a component or a software an included documentation is related to.
  |  |
  |  |- readme.txt - readme file with a information about documentation within current directory. May includes any specific or last-minute information concerning the current project.
  |  |- *.xml - source .xml files in DocBook/XML 5.1 format.
  |  |- *.fo - .fo files, generated by using docbook-pretty-playout project.
  |  |
  |  /img - directory with an image files. 
  |  |  |
  |  |  |- *.svg, *.png, ... - image files used within a documents to illustrate software features, design, etc.
  |  |
  |  /img-src - directory with a sources of an image files above.
  |     |
  |     |- *.dia, ... - source files for image files above (i.e. diagram sources, etc)
```

Due to Github is designed for and targeted mostly to a source files storage rather than a binary ones, all latter ones are stored separately at the author's website. If any of these files (i.e. generated PDFs) exist for the current software/component documentation set, a download links are provided within a related `readme.txt` file.

The project is used as a git submodule for [foponts](https://github.com/eduardtibet/foponts) and [docbook pretty playout](https://github.com/eduardtibet/docbook-pretty-playout) projects.

## Roadmap

Any enhancement of this project will be dictated solely by a needs of other projects (i.e. including new DocBook element to create some new formatting customization layer to an output PDFs) or any other hidden author's thoughts :)
